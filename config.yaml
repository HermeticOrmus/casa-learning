  # WHY PERSONAL ANCHORS MATTER - The Science
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  #
  # Your brain doesn't store information in isolation. It builds NETWORKS.
  # New knowledge sticks when it connects to existing, strong neural pathways.
  #
  # Generic analogies ("like a filing cabinet") create weak connections because
  # you don't have deep, emotional, multi-layered understanding of filing cabinets.
  #
  # But YOUR anchors - things you've spent thousands of hours on - are DENSE
  # neural networks with:
  #   • Emotional resonance (you care about them)
  #   • Procedural memory (you can DO things with them)
  #   • Rich associations (they connect to other memories)
  #   • Hierarchical understanding (you know the nuances)
  #
  # When we explain "TCP handshake" using YOUR anchor (whether that's:
  #   - A chef: "like confirming an order before cooking"
  #   - A musician: "like counting in before the song starts"
  #   - A gamer: "like the ready-check before a raid")
  #
  # ...the concept plugs into YOUR existing network, not a generic one.
  #
  # This is why two people can hear the same explanation and one remembers it
  # forever while the other forgets it instantly. The difference isn't intelligence.
  # It's whether the explanation connected to THEIR existing knowledge.
  #
  # TAKE 10 MINUTES TO FIND YOUR ANCHORS. It will save you hundreds of hours
  # of re-learning things that didn't stick the first time.
  #
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # FINDING YOUR ANCHORS - The Most Important Part
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  #
  # Anchors are domains you know DEEPLY - things you could explain to someone
  # for hours without looking anything up. The more specific, the better.
  #
  # HOW TO FIND YOUR ANCHORS:
  #
  # 1. What do you lose track of time doing?
  #    → Not "music" but "mixing hip-hop beats in Ableton"
  #    → Not "cooking" but "perfecting homemade ramen broth"
  #
  # 2. What would you explain to a curious stranger for free?
  #    → Not "sports" but "why zone defense changed basketball"
  #    → Not "movies" but "how Christopher Nolan uses time manipulation"
  #
  # 3. What have you been doing for 5+ years?
  #    → Hobbies, jobs, skills, obsessions - anything with DEPTH
  #
  # 4. What makes you say "actually, it's more nuanced than that..."?
  #    → These topics have the layers needed for good analogies
  #
  # GOOD ANCHORS have:
  #   ✓ Structure (rules, systems, hierarchies)
  #   ✓ Progression (levels, stages, evolution)
  #   ✓ Relationships (how parts connect)
  #   ✓ Edge cases (exceptions, special situations)
  #
  # EXAMPLES BY CATEGORY:
  #
  # Sports:      "Basketball pick-and-roll offense"
  #              "Marathon training periodization"
  #              "Chess opening theory"
  #
  # Creative:    "Oil painting color mixing"
  #              "Screenwriting three-act structure"
  #              "Jazz improvisation over chord changes"
  #
  # Games:       "Zelda dungeon puzzle design"
  #              "Poker pot odds and ranges"
  #              "Minecraft redstone circuitry"
  #
  # Practical:   "Sourdough fermentation"
  #              "Car engine troubleshooting"
  #              "Gardening soil ecosystems"
  #
  # Professional: "Restaurant kitchen workflow"
  #               "Construction project management"
