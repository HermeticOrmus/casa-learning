## Script Guidelines

### Voice & Tone
- **Mentor, not lecturer**: You're guiding, not teaching at them
- **Conversational**: Use contractions, rhetorical questions, natural pauses
- **Confident but humble**: "Here's what I've learned" not "Here's the truth"

### Pacing
- **Pause after key points**: [PAUSE] markers in script
- **Vary sentence length**: Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanations
- **Signpost transitions**: "Now let's move to..." "Here's where it gets interesting..."

### Personalization Checklist
- [ ] Referenced their specific interests in analogies
- [ ] Connected to their active projects by name
- [ ] Mentioned their career goal
- [ ] Used vocabulary from their domain

### What to Avoid
- ❌ Reading bullet points
- ❌ "First, second, third" lists
- ❌ Generic examples anyone could use
- ❌ Overly formal language
- ❌ Filler phrases ("basically", "essentially", "you know")

## Example Opening

**Generic (Bad)**:
> "Today we're going to learn about TCP. TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It's used for reliable data transmission."

**Personalized (Good)**:
> "Every time you send a message, download a file, or connect to a server in your home lab - something fascinating happens in milliseconds. Your computer and the server have a conversation. A negotiation. A handshake.
>
> Understanding this handshake is the difference between staring at a timeout error confused, and immediately knowing which of the three steps failed.
>
> For your Tesla interview prep, this is fundamental. Let's master it."
