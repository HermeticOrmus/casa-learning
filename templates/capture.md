## Tips for Effective Captures

1. **Use YOUR analogies**: "It's like in [show/game you love]..." beats generic examples
2. **Be specific on projects**: Not "useful for work" but "I can use this in the auth flow of my app"
3. **Make it actionable**: The TRY NOW should be copy-paste ready
4. **Tag for retrieval**: Future you will thank present you

## Examples of Good ELI5s

❌ Generic: "It's like a filing cabinet for data"
✅ Personal: "It's like the inventory system in Resident Evil 4 - limited slots, strategic choices"

❌ Generic: "It's a way to verify identity"
✅ Personal: "It's like the Patronus in Harry Potter - only YOU can produce your specific one"

❌ Generic: "It connects different services"
✅ Personal: "It's like the Megazord combining - separate parts that form something more powerful together"
