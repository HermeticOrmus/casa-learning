# Getting Started with CASA

Get your learning system running in 10 minutes.

## Choose Your Path

### Path A: Minimal (5 minutes)

Just want to try it? Start here.

1. **Create an inbox folder**
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/casa-inbox
   ```

2. **Copy the capture template**
   Save this somewhere you can copy-paste from:
   ```
   📖 TERM:
   💡 ELI5:
   🔗 PROJECTS:
   ⌨️ TRY:
   ```

3. **Start capturing**
   Every time you learn something, paste the template into a new note and fill it out.

4. **Review weekly**
   Go through your captures, expand them into full cards.

That's it. The system works even at this minimal level.

### Path B: Obsidian Setup (15 minutes)

Best for: Knowledge workers, developers, anyone who likes markdown.

1. **Install Obsidian**: https://obsidian.md

2. **Create vault structure**:
   ```
   mkdir -p CASA/{00-Inbox,01-Processing,02-Knowledge-Base,03-Audio,Templates}
   ```

3. **Install plugins**:
   - Templater
   - QuickAdd
   - Dataview

4. **Copy templates** from `templates/` folder

5. **Set up QuickAdd hotkey**: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + C`

Full guide: [workflows/obsidian/README.md](../workflows/obsidian/README.md)

### Path C: Mobile-First (10 minutes)

Best for: Commuters, people who learn on the go.

1. **Create a "Notes to Self" chat**
   - WhatsApp: Message yourself
   - Telegram: Use "Saved Messages"
   - Discord: Create a personal server

2. **Pin the capture template**

3. **Capture immediately** when you learn something

4. **Weekly processing**:
   - Copy captures to markdown files
   - Structure into cards
   - Generate audio

## Your First Capture

Try this right now with something you learned recently:

```markdown
📖 TERM: [Something you learned this week]

💡 ELI5: [Explain it using something you love - a game, show, hobby]

🔗 MY PROJECTS:
• [How could this help a current project?]
• [What problem does this solve for you?]

⌨️ TRY NOW:
[One thing you can do RIGHT NOW to apply this]

🏷️ Tags: #[topic]
```

**Example**:

```markdown
📖 TERM: Git Rebase

💡 ELI5: Like editing your save file history in a game. Instead of showing
"died 15 times on this boss," you make it look like a clean victory.
Rebase rewrites your commit history to look cleaner.

🔗 MY PROJECTS:
• Portfolio site: Clean up messy "fix typo" commits before PR
• Learning: Understand why team lead asked me to rebase before merging

⌨️ TRY NOW:
git log --oneline -10  # See your current messy history

🏷️ Tags: #git #workflow
```

## The 30-Second Rule

The most important rule: **Capture within 30 seconds of learning.**

Your brain starts forgetting immediately. The capture doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to exist.

Bad capture that exists > Perfect capture you never made

---

## Weekly Review Checklist

Every week, spend 30 minutes:

- [ ] Process inbox captures into structured cards
- [ ] Add connections between related cards
- [ ] Identify gaps (what should I learn next?)
- [ ] Generate audio for new cards (optional)
- [ ] Listen to audio during the week

---

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Making captures too long
Bad: Writing an essay
Good: Capture the essence in 30 seconds, expand later

### 2. Using generic analogies
Bad: "It's like a filing cabinet"
Good: "It's like the inventory in Resident Evil 4"

### 3. Skipping project connections
Bad: "This seems useful"
Good: "In my portfolio site, this would let me..."

### 4. Never reviewing captures
Bad: Captures pile up unprocessed
Good: Weekly processing is sacred time

### 5. Perfectionism
Bad: Waiting until you understand completely
Good: Capture confusion too - future you will figure it out

## Next Steps

1. **Make your first 5 captures** this week
2. **Process them** into structured cards on Sunday
3. **Try audio generation** with one topic
4. **Iterate** - adjust the system to fit your workflow
