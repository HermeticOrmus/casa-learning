# The Science Behind CASA

CASA isn't built on intuition alone. Each phase is grounded in cognitive science research spanning decades of memory, learning, and knowledge acquisition studies.

## The Research Foundation

### 1. Encoding Specificity Principle

**Researchers**: Endel Tulving & Donald Thomson (1973)

**Finding**: Memory retrieval is most effective when the context at retrieval matches the context at encoding.

**What this means**: If you learn something in a generic, decontextualized way ("TCP provides reliable delivery"), you'll struggle to retrieve it in specific contexts. But if you encode it with personal context ("TCP is like that friend who always confirms they got your message"), retrieval becomes easier because you have a unique pathway to the memory.

**How CASA applies this**:
- Personal analogies create unique encoding contexts
- Project connections establish retrieval cues
- Multiple modalities (text, audio) create redundant pathways

### 2. Elaborative Interrogation

**Researchers**: Pressley, McDaniel, and colleagues (1987-1992)

**Finding**: Asking "why" and "how" questions during learning significantly improves retention compared to simple reading or rote repetition.

**What this means**: Passive reading leads to shallow encoding. Active questioning—"Why does this work? How does this connect to what I know?"—forces deeper processing.

**The effect size**: Elaborative interrogation improves recall by 1.5-2x compared to reading alone.

**How CASA applies this**:
- The ELI5 field forces you to ask "How can I explain this?"
- Project connections ask "How would I use this?"
- The card Question/Answer format builds interrogation into structure

**Citation**: Pressley, M., McDaniel, M. A., Turnure, J. E., Wood, E., & Ahmad, M. (1987). Generation and precision of elaboration: Effects on intentional and incidental learning. *Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition*, 13(2), 291-300.

### 3. Dual Coding Theory

**Researcher**: Allan Paivio (1971, 1986)

**Finding**: Information encoded through both verbal and non-verbal (visual, auditory) channels creates stronger, more retrievable memory traces than single-channel encoding.

**What this means**: Reading notes (verbal) and hearing them as audio (auditory) creates two independent mental representations. If one pathway fails during retrieval, the other can succeed.

**How CASA applies this**:
- Structure phase: Visual/textual encoding (reading cards)
- Absorb phase: Auditory encoding (listening to narrative)
- Analogies: Often invoke visual imagery ("imagine a three-way handshake like...")

**Citation**: Paivio, A. (1986). *Mental representations: A dual coding approach*. Oxford University Press.

### 4. The Spacing Effect

**Researcher**: Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885), later expanded by many

**Finding**: Distributing learning over time (spaced practice) dramatically outperforms concentrated learning (massed practice) for long-term retention.

**What this means**: Studying something once for 4 hours produces worse retention than studying it 4 times for 1 hour each, spread over days or weeks.

**The effect size**: Spaced practice can improve retention by 2-3x for the same total time invested.

**How CASA applies this**:
- Captures happen at moment of learning (Day 0)
- Structuring happens later that day or week (Day 1-7)
- Audio listening happens over following weeks (ongoing)
- Review cycles continue spacing (Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 30)

The four phases naturally create temporal spacing without requiring rigid scheduling.

### 5. The Generation Effect

**Researchers**: Norman Slamecka & Peter Graf (1978)

**Finding**: Self-generated information is remembered better than passively received information, even when the generated content is identical.

**What this means**: Writing your own explanation of TCP's three-way handshake produces stronger memory than reading someone else's explanation—even if the words are the same.

**How CASA applies this**:
- ELI5 requires you to generate your own analogy
- Cards require you to write the explanation, not copy it
- Audio scripts are narratives YOU create (or that feel personal)

**Citation**: Slamecka, N. J., & Graf, P. (1978). The generation effect: Delineation of a phenomenon. *Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory*, 4(6), 592-604.

---

### 6. Testing Effect (Retrieval Practice)

**Researchers**: Roediger & Karpicke (2006), many others

**Finding**: The act of retrieving information from memory strengthens that memory more than re-studying the information.

**What this means**: Taking a test (or quizzing yourself) is not just assessment—it's a powerful learning event. Each successful retrieval strengthens the neural pathway.

**The effect size**: Testing produces 50-100% better retention than equal time spent re-reading.

**How CASA applies this**:
- Cards are structured as Q&A, enabling self-testing
- Review cycles are retrieval practice sessions
- The Question field should test understanding, not just recall

**Citation**: Roediger, H. L., & Karpicke, J. D. (2006). Test-enhanced learning: Taking memory tests improves long-term retention. *Psychological Science*, 17(3), 249-255.

---

### 7. Cognitive Load Theory

**Researcher**: John Sweller (1988, 1994)

**Finding**: Working memory has severe limits (~4 items). Learning is impaired when cognitive load exceeds capacity.

**What this means**: Complex information presented all at once overwhelms working memory. Chunking, scaffolding, and gradual complexity help.

**How CASA applies this**:
- Capture phase: Minimal structure, capture the essence only
- Structure phase: Organized format reduces load during review
- Audio phase: Narrative pacing allows processing time
- Consistent templates: Reduce format-related cognitive load

**Citation**: Sweller, J. (1988). Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning. *Cognitive Science*, 12(2), 257-285.

### 8. Desirable Difficulties

**Researcher**: Robert Bjork (1994)

**Finding**: Learning conditions that appear to slow learning often enhance long-term retention. Easy learning → fast forgetting. Difficult learning → durable memory.

**What this means**: If learning feels too easy, you're probably not forming durable memories. Some struggle is desirable.

**How CASA applies this**:
- Creating your own analogies is harder than reading existing ones—but more effective
- Spaced review is harder than massed practice—but more durable
- Retrieval practice (Q&A) is harder than re-reading—but strengthens memory

**Citation**: Bjork, R. A. (1994). Memory and metamemory considerations in the training of human beings. In J. Metcalfe & A. Shimamura (Eds.), *Metacognition: Knowing about knowing* (pp. 185-205). MIT Press.

### 9. Transfer-Appropriate Processing

**Researchers**: Morris, Bransford, & Franks (1977)

**Finding**: Memory is best when the cognitive processes during learning match the cognitive processes during retrieval.

**What this means**: If you'll need to *apply* knowledge (not just recall it), you should *practice application* during learning.

**How CASA applies this**:
- "Use Cases" field practices application thinking
- "Try Now" field creates immediate application
- Project connections simulate real retrieval contexts
- Audio narratives include application scenarios

**Citation**: Morris, C. D., Bransford, J. D., & Franks, J. J. (1977). Levels of processing versus transfer appropriate processing. *Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior*, 16(5), 519-533.

---

### 10. The Self-Reference Effect

**Researchers**: Rogers, Kuiper, & Kirker (1977)

**Finding**: Information processed in relation to the self is better remembered than information processed in other ways.

**What this means**: "How does this relate to ME?" is the most powerful encoding question. Personal relevance creates durable memories.

**How CASA applies this**:
- Every capture asks about YOUR projects
- Analogies come from YOUR interests
- Career connections relate to YOUR goals
- You become the center of your knowledge network

**Citation**: Rogers, T. B., Kuiper, N. A., & Kirker, W. S. (1977). Self-reference and the encoding of personal information. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 35(9), 677-688.

## How The Phases Map to Research

| Phase | Primary Research | Secondary Research |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Capture** | Encoding Specificity, Self-Reference | Cognitive Load, Spacing Effect |
| **Anchor** | Elaborative Interrogation, Generation Effect | Self-Reference, Transfer-Appropriate |
| **Structure** | Cognitive Load, Dual Coding | Testing Effect, Desirable Difficulties |
| **Absorb** | Dual Coding, Spacing Effect | Transfer-Appropriate Processing |

## The Compound Effect

These aren't isolated findings. They compound:

1. **Capture** leverages encoding specificity and self-reference
2. **Anchor** adds elaboration and generation
3. **Structure** enables testing and reduces load
4. **Absorb** provides dual coding and spacing
5. **Review** cycles add more retrieval practice and spacing

Each phase makes the others more effective. The whole is greater than the sum of parts.

## Skepticism Welcome

Science is provisional. These findings are robust but not absolute. What works on average may not work for you specifically.

Use CASA as a starting hypothesis. Experiment. Keep what works. Discard what doesn't. Your learning is yours to optimize.
