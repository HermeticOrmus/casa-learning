## The Problem

You consume content constantly—courses, tutorials, documentation, videos. A week later, you remember almost nothing. Notes sit untouched. Bookmarks pile up. The knowledge never becomes *yours*.

## The Solution

CASA is a 4-phase system that transforms passive consumption into active knowledge through:

1. **Immediate capture** before memory fades
2. **Personal anchoring** to your interests and projects
3. **Structured reference** for future retrieval
4. **Passive absorption** during downtime

```
CAPTURE → ANCHOR → STRUCTURE → ABSORB
   ↓         ↓          ↓          ↓
Instant   Personal   Reference   Passive
 grab     meaning     system    repetition
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/casa-learning.git
cd casa-learning

# Copy the configuration template
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml

# Edit with your personal anchors
# - Your interests (games, shows, hobbies)
# - Your active projects
# - Your career goals
```

Create your first capture:

```markdown
📖 TERM: [What you just learned]

💡 ELI5: [Explain using YOUR analogy]

🔗 MY PROJECTS:
• [How this applies to Project A]
• [How this applies to Project B]

⌨️ TRY NOW:
[One command or action to apply this immediately]
```

---

## The Four Phases

### Phase 1: CAPTURE

**Goal**: Grab knowledge within 30 seconds of learning it.

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Immediate | Working memory decays exponentially |
| Frictionless | One action maximum |
| Mobile-ready | Learning happens everywhere |

**Trigger**: The moment you think "I should remember this."

**Anti-pattern**: "I'll write this down later." (You won't.)

---

### Phase 2: ANCHOR

**Goal**: Connect new knowledge to existing mental models.

The brain doesn't store isolated facts—it stores *relationships*. By explicitly connecting new concepts to things you already know deeply (games, shows, hobbies, projects), you create multiple retrieval paths.

**The Anchor Formula**:

```markdown
📖 TERM: [Concept Name]

💡 ELI5:
[Analogy from YOUR world—not generic examples]

🔗 PROJECT CONNECTIONS:
• Project A: [Specific application]
• Project B: [Specific application]
• Career Goal: [Why this matters for your path]

⌨️ IMMEDIATE ACTION:
[Command, code snippet, or action to try RIGHT NOW]

🏷️ Tags: #topic #subtopic #skill
```

**Key Insight**: Generic analogies ("it's like a filing cabinet") don't stick. Personal analogies ("it's like the Materia system in Final Fantasy VII") create emotional hooks that persist.

---

### Phase 3: STRUCTURE

**Goal**: Create searchable, reviewable reference material.

Raw captures are messy. Structure transforms them into a knowledge base you'll actually use.

**Card Format**:

```markdown
### Card N - [Term]
Q: [Question that tests understanding]
A: [Concise answer]

**ELI5:** [Your personal analogy]

**Commands/Code:**
```bash
# Practical, copy-paste ready
command --with flags
```

**Use Cases:**
- Real application 1
- Real application 2
- Real application 3

Tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
Source: [Course/Book/Video - Section]
```

**File Organization**:

```
knowledge-base/
├── cybersecurity/
│   ├── networking-fundamentals.md
│   ├── nmap-scanning.md
│   └── wireshark-analysis.md
├── programming/
│   ├── python-patterns.md
│   └── typescript-advanced.md
└── _templates/
    ├── capture-template.md
    └── card-template.md
```

---

### Phase 4: ABSORB

**Goal**: Passive reinforcement during downtime.

Convert structured cards into narrative audio for listening during:
- Commutes
- Workouts
- Gaming sessions
- Household chores
- Walking

**Audio Style Guidelines**:

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Narrative storytelling | Bullet point reading |
| Conversational tone | Lecture format |
| Personal references | Generic examples |
| 10-30 minute episodes | 2-minute clips |
| Mentor voice | Robotic TTS |

**Script Structure**:

```
1. Hook: Why this matters to YOU
2. Foundation: Core concept explained simply
3. Deep dive: Technical details with analogies
4. Application: How to use this in your projects
5. Callback: Reinforce the key insight
```

## AI Integration

CASA is designed to work with AI assistants. Fill out `config.yaml` once, and AI personalizes every learning interaction.

### Supported Tools

| Tool | Setup | Files Used |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Claude Code** | Automatic | `CLAUDE.md` + `config.yaml` |
| **Cursor** | Automatic | `.cursorrules` + `config.yaml` |
| **ChatGPT** | Custom GPT | `ai/chatgpt-custom-gpt.md` |
| **Claude.ai** | Project files | `CLAUDE.md` + `config.yaml` |
| **Any AI** | Paste prompt | `ai/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` |

### Quick Setup (Claude Code / Cursor)

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/casa-learning.git
cd casa-learning

# 2. Fill out your profile
# Edit config.yaml with your interests, projects, career goal

# 3. Start learning (Claude Code)
claude
> explain kubernetes pods
> /capture what I just learned
```

### Commands (When Using AI)

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/learn [topic]` | Teach using your personal anchors |
| `/capture [topic]` | Create a CASA-formatted capture |
| `/card [topic]` | Generate a full knowledge card |
| `/review` | Quiz on recent captures |
| `/connect [topic]` | Map connections to your projects |

### How It Works

```yaml
# Your config.yaml
profile:
  interests: ["Dragon Ball Z", "cooking"]
  projects: [{name: "Home Lab", context: "Proxmox cluster"}]
  career:
    target: "Senior DevOps Engineer"
```

**Without CASA AI**: "TCP uses a three-way handshake like a phone call..."

**With CASA AI**: "TCP is like the power-up acknowledgment in Dragon Ball Z. Before Goku and Vegeta fight, they both power up and confirm they see each other's level. In your Home Lab, this is happening every time your VMs establish a connection..."

## The Science

### Why CASA Works

**1. Encoding Specificity** (Tulving & Thomson, 1973)
> Memory retrieval is most effective when the context at retrieval matches the context at encoding.

Personal analogies create unique, emotionally-charged encoding contexts that are easier to retrieve than generic examples.

**2. Elaborative Interrogation** (Pressley et al., 1987)
> Asking "why" and "how" questions during learning significantly improves retention.

The anchor phase forces elaborative processing: "How does this connect to my project? Why does this matter for my career?"

**3. Dual Coding Theory** (Paivio, 1971)
> Information encoded both visually and verbally creates stronger memory traces.

Structure (visual/text) + Absorb (audio) = redundant encoding pathways.

**4. Spacing Effect** (Ebbinghaus, 1885)
> Distributed practice over time beats massed practice.

The four phases naturally distribute exposure: immediate capture, same-day structuring, later audio listening, periodic review.

**5. Generation Effect** (Slamecka & Graf, 1978)
> Self-generated information is remembered better than passively received information.

Writing your own analogies and project connections requires generation, not just consumption.

## Philosophy

CASA is built on a simple premise: **the goal isn't to collect knowledge—it's to become someone who knows.**

Most learning systems optimize for collection. More notes. More bookmarks. More saved articles. But collection without transformation is just hoarding.

CASA optimizes for **connection**:
- Connect new concepts to what you already know (your interests)
- Connect new skills to what you're building (your projects)
- Connect new capabilities to who you're becoming (your career)

### Core Beliefs

1. **Personal beats generic**: Your analogy using Dragon Ball Z will stick better than any textbook explanation.

2. **Active beats passive**: Writing your own explanation strengthens memory more than reading someone else's.

3. **Multi-modal beats single-channel**: Reading + hearing + doing = durable knowledge.

4. **Imperfect capture beats perfect organization**: A messy note that exists is infinitely more valuable than a perfect system you never use.

5. **Transformation is the goal**: You're not building a knowledge base. You're building a different version of yourself.

For the full philosophy, see [`docs/philosophy.md`](docs/philosophy.md).

For the cognitive science research backing CASA, see [`docs/research.md`](docs/research.md).

## Contributing

This system is intentionally minimal. Contributions should:

1. **Add workflow examples** for different tools/contexts
2. **Improve templates** based on real usage
3. **Share anchor libraries** (gaming terms, movie analogies, etc.)
4. **Build integrations** (scripts, plugins, automations)

Please don't add complexity for its own sake. The power is in the simplicity.
